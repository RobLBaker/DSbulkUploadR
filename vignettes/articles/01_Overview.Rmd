# What this Package Does

The `DSbulkUploadR` package only requires using two R functions: 
`write_input_template()` creates an excel spreadsheet (DSbulkUploadR_input.xlsx) with a separate sheet for each supported reference type. After the .xlsx file is populated, a second function `bulk_reference_generation()` takes the data in the input.xlsx file and uses it to perform the bulk upload. The bulk upload consists of:

1) Data validation
3) Create draft reference(s) on DataStore
4) Populate each draft reference with the supplied information
5) Upload **all** the file(s) in the specified directory to the draft reference(s)
6) Connect your reference to a pre-existing DataStore Project reference

The `bulk_reference generation()` will return a dataframe containing all of the information supplied in the input .xlsx file with one additional column containing the datastore reference ID for each newly created reference. You may wish to write this dataframe to a .csv, .txt, or similar for your records.

# What this Package Doesn't
1) Connect to the VPN or to the NPS network for you (you must be connected to the network to use these functions)
2) Register ORCiDs for authors
3) Add an author's ORCID to their Active Directory/Entra ID account
4) Provide peer, technical, administrative, or other review of the reference(s) created
5) Add taxonomy to the reference(s)
6) Activate ("publish") the reference(s)

# Supported DataStore Reference Types
1) Audio Recording
2) Generic Document

# Supported File Types
Upload of all file types is supported. There is no distinction made among file types and no need to designate specific file types. Changing the default settings can result in virtually limitless numbers and sizes of files to upload. Use caution when changing the default settings!
