# Overview
The input template is designed to be easy to understand and human-readable with some data validation incorporated into the .xlsx file. Yet, it will be used as computer input and so must be crafted with some rules that may not seem intuitive. Please take care to read these instructions when populating the DSbulkUploadR_input.xlsx template. Do **not** change any of the column names or sheet names. 

Each reference type on DataStore has a specific set of back-end attributes. You must **use a reference-type specific sheet** within the DSbulkdUploadR_input.xlsx file (see [Generate the Input File](02_Generate-the-Input-File.html). The sheets within the input.xlsx may had different columns. If your reference-type specific input.xlsx sheet lacks a column, you can safely ignore the instructions for that column. However, you cannot leave any blanks in the .xlsx sheet for your reference type. Do not delete, edit, or change the column names or sheet names.

Most of the data you supply will be subjected to a series of data validation checks to make sure it is correctly formatted. If any errors are found, you will be given an opportunity to fix them prior to performing the bulk reference generation. But it is much faster to supply the data correctly the first time (and there are likely ways to do it incorrectly that the checks cannot account for). So please read the instructions carefully.

The DSbulkUploadR_input.xlsx template file also has some basic validation built in for some of the simpler columns. However, even this basic validation will not work if you copy and paste data into the sheet so copy and paste with care (why you does the validation ignore copy-paste data you ask? This is a GREAT question and I encourage you to address it directly to Microsoft....good luck).

One common problem is with date formats and Excel. Excel LOVES to reformat dates and hates ISO 8601 date format (again why? GREAT question for the Microsoft development team). Please see the section below, "[Working with dates](#working-with-dates)" for how to mitigate the issue.

## Reference type
In the "reference_type" column put the reference type for the reference to be created using the data in that particular row. Within each sheet, the reference_type should be the same and should be the same type as indicated by the sheet name (e.g. in the sheet AudioRecording, the reference_type column should consist of exclusively the value "AudioRecording"). This column is subject to data validation in excel. There should be a drop-down selection tool on each cell in the column with a single valid value you can select.

For a full list of reference types, see the [DataStore swagger documentation for the appropriate API](https://irmaservices.nps.gov/datastore/v7/documentation/datastore-api.html#/Lookup%20Lists/FixedList_GetReferenceTypes)

## Files to upload
The file_path column in the input.xlsx file specifies the location of the file(s) to upload to each reference created on DataStore. This could be a full path name starting with "C:\\users\documents\etc" or it could be a relative path from the current directory. You do not need to specify the file name(s), just the path to the files. All of the files within the specified directory will be uploaded to the reference created regardless of file type. 

This is one of the places you could make a critical mistakes with fairly large consequences. If for instance you set the file path to just "C:\\", the function would attempt to upload ALL of the files on your hard drive. please make sure your the directory you supply is as specific as possible and contains all the files that you want uploaded to that specific reference and no other files.

Each new reference should have its own file path specified. This means that you need to organize your files such that you have a directory of files associated with a specific reference you intend to create. You should have all the files associated with that reference and nothing else in that directory.

### Checks on files uploads
The `bulk_reference_generation()` function can impose some limits on the total number and size of files to be uploaded. By default, the function will produce a warning if you attempt to upload 250 or more files or 1 or more GB of data at a time (not per reference but for the entire process). The function will produce an error and fail to upload any files if you attempt to upload 500 or more files or 10 GB or more data at a time.  These parameters are easily adjusted to suite your needs. See the documentation on [`bulk_reference_generation`](https://nationalparkservice.github.io/DSbulkUploadR/reference/bulk_reference_generation.html)

Additionally, before the `bulk_reference_generation()` function creates anything on DataStore, you will be informed of the total number of references the function will create, the total number of files it will upload, and the total data volume (in GB) that will be uploaded. You will have an option to proceed or end the function if any of these values do not look correct to you.

## 508 
You will need to supply information on whether the files you are uploading to each reference are 508 compliant ("Yes") or not ("No"). These values apply to ALL of the files in the supplied file path/for a given reference and will be universally applied to all of the files uploaded to each reference. References cannot have mixes of files some of which are 508 compliant and some of which are not.  However, different references can have different 508 compliance values associated with them.

This column is subject to data validation within excel; when you click on a cell in this column a drop-down menus should appear from which you can select one of the only two valid responses: yes or no.

## Reference title
The column title in the input.xlsx file should contain your Reference Title. Each reference (line in the input.xlsx file) requires a unique title. Supply the title without quotes surrounding it.

Titles should be informative and should not include acronyms (such as NPS units, networks, regions, divisions, etc) that may not be broadly known outside of NPS. In general a title should seek to convey the following information: What, when, and where.  What is in the reference? Where is the information from? When is the information from? For instance a veg survey from ROMO 2020-2023 might have the title "Vegetation Survey Data in Rocky Mountain National Park 2020-2023". This clearly conveys what will be in the reference (data on vegetation), where the data are from (ROMO), and what dates the data span (2020-2023, which may differ from the year it was activated/published).

Titles are limited in length to 512 characters (including spaces).

## Working with dates
To prevent excel from automatically changing your dates into a non-ISO 8601 format (anything other than YYYY-MM-DD), you need to change some global settings on your computer. For PCs search for "date and time format" from the start menu. Select "Change the date and time format" (which is part of the system settings). In the panel "Short Date" choose the date formatted as YYYY-MM-DD.

### Content begin date
The column content_begin_date in the input.xlsx file should contain the date that the content of the reference/files starts in ISO 8601 format: YYYY-MM-DD. Other formats are not accepted. The content begin date should be before today's date and before the content_end_date.

### Content end date
The column content_end_date in the input.xlsx file should contain the date that the content of the reference/files ends in ISO 8601 format: YYYY-MM-DD. Other formats are not accepted. The content end date should be before today's date and after the content_start_date.

## Length of recording
The length_of_recording column in the input.xlsx file should contain a string of characters describing the duration of the content. For instance, the length_of_recording value may be "5 hours six minutes and 32 sec" (without quotes). This value will be directly used and not parsed into any specific format.

## Description
The description column in the input.xlsx file should contain a brief description or abstract for the reference. Generally these abstracts should be less than 250 words and briefly explain the why, what, when, where, and how of the information contained in the reference. Please do not include quotations or special characters.

## Purpose
The purpose column in the input.xlsx file should contain a brief description of the purpose of the reference. The purpose may be identical to the description or may be different. 

## Notes
The notes column in the input.xlsx file should contain any notes that may be important for understanding the reference. 

## URL
The web address of the resource.

## Author email addresses
The author_email_list column in input.xlsx should contain a comma-separated list of all the authors' email addresses. Use full email addresses rather than user names (e.g. first_last@nps.gov not FMLast@nps.gov). All references require at least one author. Do not include extra text (no quotations, angle brackets, etc). 

All authors must be valid NPS employees or partners (e.g. @nps.gov, @partner.nps.gov). All authors must have registered an ORCiD and added the ORCiD to active directory/Entra ID. The ORCiD in Active Directory/Entra ID must have the format xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx.

[Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCiD)](https://info.orcid.org/what-is-orcid/) is a third-party persistent digital identifier associated with individuals rather than institutions or documents. ORCiDs are required for authors by the [NPS Open Access Plan](https://irma.nps.gov/DataStore/DownloadFile/717695) for all authors of all scholarly and scientific work. You can learn more about ORCiDs, how register them, add them to Active Directory/Entra ID, control the automated information flowing to your ORCiD profile and what information orcid.org displays about you on the [NPS Data Publication Best Practices SharePoint site page on Persistent Identifiers](https://doimspp.sharepoint.com/sites/nps-nrss-imdiv/data-publication/SitePages/Reserve-a-DOI.aspx#personal-digital-identifiers-%28orcids%29) including ORCiDs.

The `bulk_reference_generation()` function will automatically extract first name, last name, and ORCiDs based on the supplied email addresses and use that information to populate the authors of the reference.

## Licenses
The license_code column in input.xlsx should contain a numeric code (1,2,3,4 or 5) corresponding to a license for the reference on DataStore. A Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license is the preferred license for all public content on DataStore. Valid codes are as follows: 

| Valid Code  |   License     | Suggested use case  |
| :-: |:-------- | :-----|
| 1           | ["Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal (CC0)"](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/) | This is the preferred license for all public content  |
| 2           | ["Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International"](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/cc-by-4.0/) (CC-by-4.0)   | External international partners |
| 3          |    ["Creative commons Attribution Non Commercial 4.0 International"](https://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/deed.en) (CC BY-NC 4.0) | External non-commercial partners |
| 4           |  ["Public Domain"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain) | CC0 is preferred   |
| 5           | "Unlicensed (not for public dissemination)"            | Should only be used for restricted content that contains confidential unclassified information - CUI)   |

If all license codes supplied (as integers ranging from 1-5) are valid, the function passes.

## Controlled Unclassified Information

### CUI label
Enter one or more reasons why these data should be restricted. Each reason should be separated by a comma. If data should not be restricted, use the CUI label "PUBLIC" (without quotations). The following are valid CUI labels. If your reference does not fall into one of these categories it likely cannot be restricted. If you feel strongly that it should or must be restricted despite not fitting into any of the accepted categories, please contact [Joe DeViVo](mailto:joe_divivo@nps.gov) or [Judd Patterson](mailto:judd_patterson@nps.gov).

**The following are accepted CUI labels:**
PUBLIC
National Park System Resources
Archeological Resources
Historical Properties
Cave Resources
Paleontological Resources
Copyrighted

### CUI contact name
Please enter the name of a person who can be contacted for more information about the CUI restrictions.

### CUI contact email
Please enter an email address to contact about the CUI restrictions. It does not need to be the email address of the contact person. If there is a relevant group email that is preferable to an individual email as there can be substantial turnover in individual persons.


## Producing Unit(s)
The column producing_unit in the input.xlsx file should contain a comma-separated list of acronyms for the NPS units that contributed to producing the reference or its content. For instance, an IMD network or region might be responsible for creating a reference or its content (e.g. IMR or ROMN). These must be valid NPS unit acronyms, e.g. ROMO not RMNP for Rocky Mountain National Park or IMD for the Inventory and Monitoring Division (not IM&D). 

## Content Unit(s)
The column content_units in the input.xlsx file should contain a comma-separated list of acronyms for the NPS unit(s) where the information in the reference was collected or generated. These should be specific park units that have physical geographies and not organizational units. For instance, YELL (for Yellowstone) and/or GRTE (Grand Teton National Park) but *not* GRYN (Greater Yellowstone Network), IMD (Inventory and Monitoring Division), and not NRSS (Natural Resources Science and Stewardship Directorate), etc.

## Keywords
The keywords column in the input.xlsx file should contain a comma-separated list of keywords to be added to the reference. Each keyword can consist of a single word or multiple words but should not contain special characters (e.g. no quotes, apostrophes, etc). Keywords will automatically be sorted into alphabetical order on DataStore.

## Projects
The project_id column should contain one or more (separated by a comma) DataStore Project type reference codes. The newly created reference on DataStore will automatically be added to the Project. The Project must already exist on DataStore, however it can be in draft mode.
