# What this Package Does

The `DSbulkUploadR` package only requires using two R functions: 
`make_input_template()` creates a DataStore reference-specific template input.txt file. After youpopulate the input.txt file, a second function `bulk_reference_generation()` takes the data in the input.txt file and uses it to perform the bulk upload. The bulk upload consists of:

1) Create draft reference(s) on DataStore
2) Populate each draft reference with the supplied information
3) Upload **all** the file(s) in the specified directory to the draft reference(s)

The `bulk_reference generation()` will return a dataframe containing all of the information supplied in the input .txt file with one additinal column containing the datastore reference ID for each newly created reference. You may wish to write this dataframe to a .csv, .txt, or similar for your records.

# What this Package Doesn't
1) Connect to the VPN or to the NPS network for you (you must be connected to the network to use these functions)
2) Register ORCiDs for authors
3) Add an author's ORCID to their Active Directory/Entra ID account
4) Provide peer, technical, administrative, or other review of the reference(s) created
5) Add taxonomy to the reference(s)
6) Activate ("publish") the reference(s)

# Supported DataStore Reference Types

# Supported File Types
Upload of all file types is supported. There is no distinction made among file types and no need to designate specific file types. Changing the default settings can result in virtually limitless numbers and sizes of files to upload. Use caution when changing the default settings!
